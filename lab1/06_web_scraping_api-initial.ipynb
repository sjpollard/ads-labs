    "# The Guardian API\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `05_web_scraping_beautiful_soup.ipynb` notebook, we saw examples on how BeautifulSoup can be used \n",
    "to parse messy HTML, to extract information, and to act as a rudimentary web crawler. \n",
    "We used The Guardian as an illustrative example about how this can be achieved. \n",
    "The reason for choosing The Guardian was because they provide a REST API to their servers. \n",
    "With the REST API it is possible to perform specific queries on their servers, and to receive \n",
    "current information from their servers according to their API guide (ie in JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use their API, you will need to register for an API key. \n",
    "At the time of writing (Jan 24, 2022) this was an automated process that can be completed at \n",
    "\n",
    "https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer\n",
    "\n",
    "On registration you will receive an API key which will look like: 303qwe2k-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-eff86a248059\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is documented here: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/\n",
    "\n",
    "and Python bindings to their API are provided by The Guardian here\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/prabhath6/theguardian-api-python\n",
    "\n",
    "and these can easily be integrated into a web-crawler based on API calls, rather than being based \n",
    "on HTML parsing, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use four parameters in our queries here: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `section`: the section of the newspaper that we are interested in querying. In this case we will look at \n",
    "the technology section \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `order-by`: We have specified that the newest items should be closer to the front of the query list \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `api-key`: In this notebook, the api-key is left as `test` (works here), but for *real* deployment of such a spider an API key obtained from Guardian should be specified. For the lab tasks, you should replace `test` API key with your personal API key. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `page-size`: The number of results to return. "
